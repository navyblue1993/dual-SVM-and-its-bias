# dual-SVM-and-its-bias
It's a study on dual SVM problem and the impact on our choosing on bias term

From "Foundation of Machine Learning", page 91. It's said that bias term can be obtained from any support vector x lying on a marginal hyperplane, that's any vector x with 0 < alpha < C.
But from my experiments, we try every bias term which satisfied the constraint, the accuracy is a curve and the accuracy varied with different bias.
